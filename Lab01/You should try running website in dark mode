If you turn system appearence on windows 10 or mac os Mojave to dark mode, webpage looks geourgeus in dark

If you can't set appearence in your os just comment out "@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)" part.

Also I don't know why I shipped 1x and 0.5x assets when I have SVGs, but that's just what my Adobe Illustrator settings are set to export
